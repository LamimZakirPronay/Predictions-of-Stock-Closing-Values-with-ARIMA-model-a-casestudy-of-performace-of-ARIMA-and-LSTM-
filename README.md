The stock market is a complex system that is influenced by various economic and financial
factors. Predicting the future behavior of stock prices has been a topic of interest for investors,
financial analysts, and researchers for several decades. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model is a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting stock prices as it
considers both the past and the present behavior of the stock prices. In this thesis, we analyze the
effectiveness of the ARIMA model in predicting stock prices and investigate its potential for
investment decision making. We evaluate the performance of the ARIMA model using various
performance metrics and compare it with other popular machine learning models. We also
investigate the potential of the ARIMA model for investment decision making by utilizing the
predictions generated by the model to simulate trading strategies.
